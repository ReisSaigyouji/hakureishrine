            <h2>About the Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                It exists on the boundary between this world and Gensokyo. It is simultaneously accessible from both sides,
                <br>but certain circumstances must be met in order to travel from one side to the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hakurei Shrine was once the only shrine in Gensokyo,
                but the Moriya Shrine has since settled on the Youkai Mountain.
                <br>Also adding to religious competition is the Myouren Temple and the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum.
                <br>The former is a Buddhist temple led by Byakuren Hijiri and the latter is held by Taoists run by
                Toyosatomimi no Miko.
            </p>

                    Structurally, the shrine is old-fashioned and offers poor protection from the cold.
                    <br>The grove of cherry trees behind the shrine is a particularly popular spot for flower viewing in spring.
                    <br>There's a large donation box for visitors to leave money in,
                    but since visitors are scarce, it's usually empty.
                    <br>The Yin-Yang Orb, a powerful weapon usable only by blood members of the Hakurei clan, is also kept here.
                    <br>The orb is the greatest treasure of the shrine.
