            <h2>About the Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                It exists on the boundary between this world and Gensokyo. It is simultaneously accessible from both sides,
                <br>but certain circumstances must be met in order to travel from one side to the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hakurei Shrine was once the only shrine in Gensokyo,
                but the Moriya Shrine has since settled on the Youkai Mountain.
                <br>Also adding to religious competition is the Myouren Temple and the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum.
                <br>The former is a Buddhist temple led by Byakuren Hijiri and the latter is held by Taoists run by
                Toyosatomimi no Miko.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Structurally, the shrine is old-fashioned and offers poor protection from the cold.
                    <br>The grove of cherry trees behind the shrine is a particularly popular spot for flower viewing in spring.
                    <br>There's a large donation box for visitors to leave money in,
                    but since visitors are scarce, it's usually empty.
                    <br>The Yin-Yang Orb, a powerful weapon usable only by blood members of the Hakurei clan, is also kept here.
                    <br>The orb is the greatest treasure of the shrine.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Reimu is unusually easygoing, lacking any sense of danger, and carefree.
                    She is described as simpleminded, <br>always showing her true feelings and acting on whatever ideas
                    she thinks at the top of her head.
                    <br>Reimu is someone simple who passes her days sweeping the shrine grounds,
                    drinking green tea and lazing about, <br>to the point that Kasen Ibaraki thought she lacked
                    training to be the Hakurei shrine maiden and made her train to <br>be more disciplined,
                    something that only worked for a couple of days due to her easygoing personality.
                    <br>However, Kasen states that despite Reimu being "a little unreliable and a little slovenly",
                    she still performs her duties, <br>doing enough to be befit the title of Hakurei shrine maiden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, she is someone with an intuition when it comes to incidents, usually rushing to solve them
                    <br>and not letting anybody get in her way and waste her time.
                    <br>This leads to some people she confronts to think that she has an “indescribable intimidating aura”.
                    This is backed up by her <br>innate abilities, powerful enough to beat her opponents without her being
                    worried of training often
